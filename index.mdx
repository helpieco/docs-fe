## What is Arcetix?

Arcetix is an AI-powered platform for creating, running, and scheduling end‑to‑end tests as visual workflows. Describe what you want to test in plain English and Arcetix generates an executable workflow you can review and run.

Workflows are built from nodes:

- Action: user interactions like clicks, typing, and selections
- Extraction: collect data from the page into a structured schema
- Validation: assert content, states, and counts (numbers use {value} syntax)
- Agent: delegate multi‑step reasoning when needed

Use secrets (%KEY%) and CSV data (@file/column) directly in prompts and steps. Run on demand or schedule recurring runs, then monitor status and logs.
