## Start a run

From a workflow, click Run. The latest run status updates in real time: `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

## View logs and node statuses

Open Workflow Logs to see step‑by‑step output and node status updates as the run progresses.

## Schedule recurring runs

Create schedules using presets (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) or a custom cron expression. Each schedule also selects an AI model to use for execution.

You’ll see an indicator when active schedules exist for a workflow.

## Run details

Each run has timestamps (`startedAt`, `completedAt`) and a result payload. Active runs poll automatically until completion.
