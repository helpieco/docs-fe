## Generate from a prompt

Describe what you want to test and Arcetix will propose an executable workflow. You can run it as‑is or edit steps before saving.

Tips when writing prompts:

- Be specific about targets: button labels, field names, and expected outcomes
- Use separate steps for each interaction (click, type, select)
- Prefer descriptive identifiers over colors or positions

## Use secrets in prompts and steps

Insert saved secrets anywhere using `%KEY%` syntax. For example:

```text
type %email% into the email field
type %password% into the password field
```

## Use CSV data

Upload a CSV while generating and reference columns with `@filename/column`:

```text
login as @users.csv/email with password %password%
```

## Node types

Workflows are built from nodes:

- Action: user interactions (click, type, select)
- Extraction: collect data from the page into a schema
- Validation: assert content, states, and counts
- Agent: delegate multi‑step reasoning

See detailed guides in AI Action, AI Extraction, AI Validation, and AI Agent.

## Save and open

After reviewing the AI summary, save to create the workflow. You’ll land on the workflow dashboard where you can run, monitor logs, and schedule.
