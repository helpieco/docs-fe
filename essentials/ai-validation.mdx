## When to use

Use Validation to verify content and UI state. Validation can work without prior extraction, or validate fields extracted earlier.

## Numeric values use {{value}}

Numbers in schemas use doubleâ€‘brace formatting: `{{10}}`.

## Examples

Standalone:

```text
validate that page title is Login
```

After extraction (matching field names):

```text
validate that appleCount equals {{40}}
```
