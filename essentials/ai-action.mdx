## When to use

Use Action for any user interaction: clicking buttons, typing into inputs, selecting options, navigating, etc. Keep actions atomic—one interaction per node.

## Best practices

- Identify elements by clear text/labels
- Avoid color‑based references
- Use `%variable%` placeholders to make values configurable

## Example

```text
click the "Login" button
type %email% into the "Email" field
type %password% into the "Password" field
```
