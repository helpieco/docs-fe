## When to use

Use Agent when a goal requires flexible reasoning or several sub‑steps that are hard to express as individual actions.

## Guidance

- State a clear objective and constraints
- Provide context and any relevant variables
- Prefer Action/Extraction/Validation for deterministic steps; use Agent sparingly
